									<h2>Generated Text Workshop</h2>

									<p>
										I delivered a workshop this year to students taking the UCIL20122 unit. This is an interdisciplinary unit taken by University of Manchester students
										in first, second, or third year. A large focus of our work on the unit this year was the emerging popularity of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT.
										We discussed at length the potential costs and benefits of these models, and how they might affect society, education, healthcare, and business.
									</p>
									<p>
										The workshop I delivered focused on facilitating critical discussion about these tools. We encouraged the students to analyse the text that the model
										had generated, and critique it as they would a piece of work from their peers. We talked about what the model had done well, what the model had done
										poorly, how we can tell that it indeed was generated text, and what this says about the structure of the model itself.
									</p>
									<p>
										My students reacted very positively to this workshop. Over the course of an hour we had a range of interesting discussions. These discussions started
										around the questions above, but soon evolved into discussions about the potential implications of these kinds of tools for writers and people working
										in creative industries.
									</p>
									<p> 
										Full instructions for running this workshop are available in a <a href="https://github.com/gjpstrain/generated_text_workshop">GitHub repository</a> 
										that I host. Feel free to run the workshop yourself without crediting me. Although if you would like to feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/gabe_the_strain">tweet</a>
										me about it. Also feel free to create a pull request with your experiences, ideas, successes, and failures into the 
										<a href="https://github.com/gjpstrain/generated_text_workshop/comments">comments</a> folder in the repository.
